            This opened in summer 2019 and is on the high street so it’s a good
            base to explore the city. Please note it does not have parking so
            you will have to pay for a local pay and display car park (free
            between 6pm - 8am).

            This is just behind the Travelodge, right next to the Cathedral and

            This is a little more upmarket but a little dated. Is is at the top

        <h2>Stockbridge Hotels</h2>
        <p>
          Stockbridge accommodation consists mainly of pubs with rooms but there
          are also lots of B&amp;B’s not listed here. Anything along the high
          street will be walkable from The Greyhound on the Test if you are
          making the most of our bus! We’d love to have you all close by and see
          you the next morning if you are staying in Stockbridge.
        </p>
        <p>
          The road between Houghton Lodge Gardens and Stockbridge is not safe to
          walk, so please either book a seat on our bus or arrange a taxi.
