          <p>
            We can’t wait to see you on our wedding day! Here’s some details to
            help you plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our day will start at the church in Winchester followed by the
            reception in Stockbridge which is about a 25 minute drive away.
            Please plan to make your own way between the two venues.
          </p>
          <p>
            At both the church and the evening venue there will be uneven ground
            and grass so please bear this in mind when choosing footwear. Our
            evening reception will also be under canvas so please bring warm
            clothing and wet weather gear if needed!
          </p>
          <p>
            We’d also love it if you could please bring along a
            <strong> coconut</strong> to our reception!
          </p>
          <p>If you need to contact anyone on the day please call:</p>

          <h3>12:45 - Arrival</h3>
          <p>
            There is plenty of parking on the field beside the church and this
            will be signed from the main road.
          </p>
          <h3>1 o'clock - Our marriage ceremony</h3>
          <p>
            This will be around 1 hour long so it’s worth having a late
            breakfast before you arrive!
          </p>
          <p>
            After the ceremony, please make your own way to the reception venue.
            You will drive through Stockbridge on your way so if you wanted to
            quickly stop by and check into your hotel, please do.
